		<h2>C1. Are web browsers the Holy Grail of GUI standards?</h2>
		Some people think so. Even some people who don't sell browsers think
		so. But we don't think so, because browser functionality is tailored
		to display HTML with some HTTP methods thrown in, and HTTP is a very
		narrow client/server protocol. Take the batch-mode problem, for
		instance. When a client fills out a form using a web browser, it's an
		inert data entry screen, not much different from 3270. Only when a
		batch of data is submitted does the system exhibit intelligence.
		That's the paradigm PCs were invented to transcend. The question gets
		fuzzy, though, if we open the notion of "browsers" to include virtual
		machines (e.g., HotJava), or embedded code interpreters (e.g.,
		JavaScript). Here we augment HTTP to restore client intelligence.
		These beasties could have a shot at Graildom -- market forces
		permitting. An interesting side question is which of the two competing
		paradigms for GUI unification will win. Netscape and its allies are
		pushing OS-independent, browser-based solutions; devices like Oracle's
		network computer follow this model. By contrast Microsoft continues to
		vie for desktop dominance with its Windows-centric model. "It's the
		OS, stupid." By furnishing everything from the graphics kernel to the
		IP stack to the web browser as an OS service, Microsoft chops at
		efforts to make the Internet the locus of computing technology. If you
		had to pick today, which would you choose? Let us know.
		<h2>C2. Come to think of it, is there even an HTML standard
			anymore?</h2>
		If 80% market share makes a standard, Yes. If standards are defined by
		the consensus of interested parties toward a common goal, Maybe. You
		should probably read what the standards-bearers have to say about this
		state of affairs. The reality is that market forces have driven the
		standards process since Netscape introduced . In fact, the current de
		jure standard, HTML 3.2 (code name: Wilbur), is pretty much a rubber
		stamp on the de facto standard of HTML 2.0 plus Netscape and Microsoft
		enhancements.
		<h2>C3. If everyone uses the same browser, is there any reason to
			avoid proprietary tags?</h2>
		The chief reason to avoid proprietary anything is to give yourself an
		out. In practice this translates to demanding vendor respect, since
		customers can walk. If you build a document repository using
		proprietary language features, you've wedded yourself to a vendor, a
		product line, a version, a set of experts, and possibly specific
		platforms. The vendor is, of course, under no obligation to perform in
		any of these areas. This is true irrespective of browser type. As a
		rule of thumb: systems that cost more than 5% of your annual IT budget
		should be as standards-based as you can make them without sacrificing
		requirements. The growth of the internet has given an unprecedented
		perspective to every domain of human life. Be it interacting with
		people, shopping online, collaborated working, video streaming, or
		listening to music. Among all consumer and entertainment industries,
		the Music industry in general and Electronic Music Industry in
		particular got its biggest break with the installation of Fiber optic
		cables all over the world. A piece of glass has surely made the whole
		world glitter! </br> Electronic Dance Music has become a cult since its
		inception and is one of the widely recognised form of music in the
		contemporary world. Pop, Rock, Metal, Jazz, Hip Hop, or Indie tunes,
		when mixed with the bass of electronic music creates magical tracks,
		which are so intriguing that one just can’t stop the body from syncing
		with the electronic beats. With today’s advanced communication
		technology, millions of hopeful musicians around the world are able to
		find a place on the internet to broadcast their music. For electronic
		music artists, recognizing this shift in people’s choice is the key to
		a successful campaign and to boost their career paths. </br> In the present
		context, when teenage parties, fashion shows and even, corporate
		events are incomplete without a tinge of electronic music, it’s a
		golden chance for any electronic music artist to capture the trend and
		make money/fame out of it. But, making money or achieving fame is not
		easy when you have a whole lot of market to tap and virtually no
		concrete plan on how to do it. So strategic planning, along with
		proper execution is the key to a successful music breakthrough! </br>
		Logically speaking, when everyone is promoting their music online, how
		can one shine out. In such scenarios, taking help from professional
		services helps a lot. When SoundCloud is the trending platform for
		music sharing and listening, it becomes necessary for any music
		composer to attract a fan or a music studio via SoundCloud. The more
		your outreach among your music’s niche, the more are your chances to
		become the next Prince of music! Professional services like the ones
		offered by <a href="http://www.soundcloudpromotions.com">soundcloudpromotions.com</a>
		help a lot in carving out a plan customised for you. The kind of music
		one makes, the kind of fan following one desires, and the kind of
		artist one wants to be – all are taken care of by
		SoundCloudPromotions.com </br> Assign proper tags to your music, focus on
		the audience while making music, always lookout for ways to master
		your techniques, work with like-minded artists, refer each other’s
		work and get yourself known – these are some tips to get a sure shot
		fan following in the online musical era.


		<h2>C4. Where can I find out about Netscape Navigator's HTML
			extensions?</h2>
		At netscape.com. C5. Where can I find out about Microsoft Internet
		Explorer's HTML extensions? At microsoft.com.
		<h2>C6. How useful is Plug-In technology on an intranet (versus,
			say, Helper Apps)?</h2>
		First of all, Netscape Plug-Ins are proprietary and only available for
		Windows, so see Question C3. Next, Plug-Ins are likely an interim
		technology on the way from classical web browsers to fully functional
		web clients. While they extend the browser in a modular fashion,
		Plug-Ins perpetuate a procedural programming model, acting as viewers
		for inert data. That said, Plug-Ins can be enormously helpful in
		bringing client/server benefits to an intranet. Best of all, they're
		here today. File viewers like FTP Software Keyview and Adobe Amber
		make documents format-neutral a reality; Shockwave and RealAudio do
		the same for multimedia; and myriad 3D viewers do as much for VRML
		worlds. Sure, plug into Plug-Ins ... just be prepared to disconnect
		when the Next Big Thing comes along. C7. When should I use embedded
		scripts, such as Netscape JavaScript or Microsoft JScript? Scripts,
		which operate on the client, are required to implement any
		event-driven functionality in the browser. Traditional web technology
		provides no way to detect and act on mouse clicks or typed-in text.
		You need scripts to do that. In addition, scripts can be used to make
		web pages more dynamic. Text that drifts across the browser status bar
		or a real-time clock display are common examples.
		<h2>C8. Which is better, JavaScript or VBScript?</h2>
		Ask as frequently as you like, we're not answering vendor preference
		questions! But we did find the following reasonable response on
		Usenet, courtesy of author Mark Stone: It depends on your goals. If
		you want cross platform code that will work on any scripting enabled
		browser that hits your site, then you should stick within the confines
		of JavaScript 1.0, and pay careful attention to discrepancies between
		JavaScript on Navigator 2.0, JavaScript on Navigator 3.0, and JScript
		on Explorer 3.0. There are a number of discrepancies, but they can
		almost always be worked around to achieve the same general result in a
		way that works on all these browsers. If you don't care about cross
		platform code then it really depends on what your programming
		background is, and whether you want to use ActiveX controls.
		JavaScript is a more naturally object oriented language, which is a
		plus. If you already know Visual Basic, however, then you will find it
		easier to use VBScript. If you plan on making extensive use of ActiveX
		controls you should also consider VBScript. While JScript on IE can
		interact with ActiveX controls, the interaction is more seamless using
		VBScript, and the VBScript/ActiveX connection is better documented.
		<h2>C9. I've heard that there are several incompatible versions
			of JavaScript out there: v1.0, v1.1, JScript, etc. Which "standard"
			should I code to?</h2>
		As long as rugged individualism conflicts with community spirit, there
		won't be a satisfactory answer to this question -- or any other
		concerning multiple, competing "standards." That's an interesting bit
		of philosophy, you say, but it doesn't help much? Here are some facts
		to help you make a decision. JavaScript is a Netscape trademark and,
		despite the open availability of the API, is proprietary to that
		company's browsers. JScript is Microsoft's implementation of
		JavaScript for the Internet Explorer line. JScript and JavaScript 1.0
		are roughly equivalent (with exceptions documented in books like Mark
		Stone's How to Program Microsoft JScript; cf. C8). With v3.0 of
		Navigator, Netscape introduced an enhanced JavaScript (v1.1) with
		features not available in any other browser. Nice features ... if you
		don't mind a little lock-in. The following excerpts from newsgroup
		comp.lang.javascript make the same points with more, er, esprit de
		corps "For as long as IE exists, you can't write a piece of code worth
		writing and make it browser-independent. Unless MS actually gets an IQ
		or two and gets JavaScript right".rant() JScript doesn't support the
		image array. Which means that your script is NS3.0 only. which is a
		Major bummer, esp with [dynamic graphics] in your application. So,
		only thing you can do is test to make sure navigator.appName =
		"Netscape" and navigator.appVerson.substring(0,1) = 3 before you run
		your stuff. G'Luck. Response, posted later that day For as long as
		Netscape does not implement an "open" JavaScript you can't write a
		piece of code browser independent. I have to say that writing
		JavaScript 1.0 in IE 3.0 is a joy compared to writing JavaScript 1.0
		in Netscape 2.x. If you use Netscape 3.0 and JavaScript 1.1, your code
		will run nowhere else.
